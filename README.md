# SMearch
The original purpose of this code is to be a Social Media Search Engine, or SMearch, that key word searches through the discovered items provided by snscrape and allows a filtering for specific types, ex: posts or profile names. The UI will then provide it's results in a search engine results format.

However, with a short amount of time to complete each sprint, the objective has changed to just be a program that will print out the screen names of Twitter/X accounts that match the specified keyword.

Project Roadmap:

- [x] Find related repository and evaluate it
- [x] Test repository
- [ ] Pull portions of the code that support the new objective of this program to a seperate .py file
- [ ] Use the Twitter/X developer portal to have API credentials
- [ ] Complete and test code.
- [ ] Possibly create a UI for the code if it works.
- [ ] Possibly add a feature that will print out the text of the tweets that contain the specified keyword
- [ ] Retest the code if the previous 2 proposed additions are implemented.
