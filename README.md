# PLearch
The original purpose of forking the snscrape code was to be a Social Media Search Engine, or SMearch, that key word searches through the discovered items provided by snscrape and allows a filtering for specific types, ex: posts or profile names. 

However, since I needed to find a free way of getting a similar result, the objective has changed to just be a program opting out of using scraping but instead takes in the user's inputs (platform and search query) and uses the user's default web browser to auto search the keywords provided.

Project Roadmap:

- [x] Find related repository and evaluate it
- [x] Test repository
- [ ] Pull portions of the code that support the new objective of this program to a seperate .py file
- [ ] Complete and test code.
- [ ] Possibly add new features to code if time permits.
- [ ] Retest the code if additions are implemented.
